Demonstrated how to use Python and Azure functions to create a simple image processing application.
When using Python to build applications with Azure, there are many different solutions and use cases to choose from. Here is a simple example that demonstrates how to use Python and Azure functions to create a simple image processing application. In this example, we'll use Azure Blob storage to store images and Azure functions to create an image processing pipeline.

# Step 1: Prepare
First, you need to make sure you already have an Azure account and that you have Azure Functions Core Tools and Azure CLI installed.
# Step 2: Create an Azure storage account
Create a Blob storage account in the Azure portal and create a container called images to store the image files.
# Step 3: Create the Azure function application
Create a new Azure function application using Azure Functions Core Tools. On the command line, execute the following command:


You can use HTTP requests to test function applications. By passing the URL of the image as a parameter, the function downloads, processes, and saves the image to Azure Blob storage.

This is just a simple example of how to use Python and Azure functions to create a simple image processing application. In practice, you can extend and customize this solution according to your own needs.
